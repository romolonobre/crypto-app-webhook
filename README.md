# Crypto App

CryptoApp is a simple Flutter application designed to provide real-time cryptocurrency data using webhooks. This project serves as a starting point for learning how to consume webhooks within a Flutter app, with a focus on using the Coinbase WebSocket API for live updates. The app is in its early stages and primarily focuses on basic functionality and architecture.

# Future Plans
- Architecture Refinement: The app will be refactored to adopt a more robust and scalable architecture, following best practices for state management and code organization.
- Additional Features: Future versions will include more features such as expanded cryptocurrency support, detailed price charts, historical price
- Improved error handling

# Purpose
This project is intended as a learning tool for developers interested in understanding how to consume webhooks and integrate real-time data streams into a Flutter application. It also serves as an example of how to handle WebSocket connections and manage state in a Flutter app.
